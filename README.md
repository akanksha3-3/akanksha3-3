## Hi there 👋

I have completed my Master’s in Bioinformatics, and I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of biology, data, and technology. My journey involves exploring how we can apply computational tools to understand complex biological systems and drive innovations in healthcare and life sciences.

I enjoy working on problems that blend:
- 🧬 Biological data analysis (especially NGS & genomics)
- 💻 Python programming and scripting
- 🤖 Machine learning applications in life sciences
- 📊 Data visualization and storytelling with tools like Power BI and Tableau

I am constantly learning and experimenting through projects — whether it is developing predictive models, building dashboards, writing pipelines, or scripting something fun in Python.

This GitHub space is where I document and share my learning journey through code and analysis. If you are passionate about similar topics, feel free to explore my repositories or connect!
